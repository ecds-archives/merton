In 1964 and 1965 Thomas Merton used a red-leather "day-by-day"
  calendar for the year 1959 as a diary. Unlike his other published
  diaries and journals, this diary was not used for personal entries;
  rather he used it as a collection for the words of others. As noted
  by Erasmo Leiva-Merikakis and Jonathan Montaldo in the <a
  href="/display/preface">Foreword</a> to the print edition, "the Red
  Diary is a convergence of Merton's spontaneous attractions." This
  collection of the thoughts and writings of others provide us with
  insight into Merton's "interior climate" - "these collected'words'
  reflect his fears and his hopes, and more importantly they reflect
  his prayer, at this new and long awaited juncture in his life" -
  that of living full-time at his hermitage.<br><br>
